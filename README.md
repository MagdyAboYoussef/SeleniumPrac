# SeleniumPractice project


This project is done as a practice by me using POM design pattern and applying selenium/cucumber. It has 7 test cases and uses Edge driver.
The test cases are written in BDD using cucumber in the main/resource/features file.
To the run the test cases we run the testrunner file or to generate a well written reports we run through maven verify lifecycle.
